		<h3><i>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Channel death fuels UK - France tensions.</i></h3>
		<p><i>The deaths of at least 27 people in the English Channel is fuelling tensions between the U.K. and France over how to stop migrants from crossing the world’s busiest waterway in small boats.Despite a pledge from British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron that they would “do everything possible” to stop people smugglers from endangering lives, politicians on both sides of the channel are already sniping at their counterparts for failing to prevent Wednesday’s tragedy
		U.K. officials criticise France for rejecting their offer of the British police and border officers to conduct joint patrols along the channel coast with the French police. French authorities say Britain is stoking the crisis because it is too easy for migrants to remain in the country and work if they manage to cross the channel.Amid the finger pointing, British lawmakers on Thursday will debate the soaring number of migrants who are crossing the channel in small boats. Mr. Macron is scheduled to discuss the issue with European Union officials..</i></p>

		<h3><i>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;US should not have any illusions about Taiwan.</i></h3>
		<p><i>There is no room for compromise over Taiwan and the United States should not have any illusions about this, China’s Defence Ministry said on Thursday, adding that Washington had of late made a series of “provocations” on several issues.China says the issue of Taiwan, which it claims as Chinese territory, is the most sensitive in its ties with the United States, the country that is also Taiwan’s most important international backer and arms supplier.Sharp differences over Taiwan persisted during a virtual meeting earlier this month between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Mr. Xi said that those in Taiwan who seek independence, and their supporters in the United States, were “playing with fire”. Asked at a monthly news briefing in Beijing to comment on Sino-U.S. military ties in the light to those talks, Chinese Defence Ministry spokesman Wu Qian said having a healthy and stable relationship was good for both and what the world expected.</i></p>
